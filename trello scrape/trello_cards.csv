Through the confluence of data, models, and the deep insights of engineers and operators, we help teams harness the full capabilities of simulation models, paired with the insights of advanced data-analytics, to make better decisions, faster.

A core challenge of the Digital Transformation of water is bridging the informational, conceptual, and geographic boundaries of complex water systems. We believe that by leveraging the knowledge, data, and toolsets of distinct teams, we can identify solutions that will deliver better outcomes for utilities, for residents, and for the environment.

We work closely with consulting firms and utilities to understand how we can integrate trusted models together with data analytics in new, powerful ways to address planning and operational challenges. We develop solutions that enhance the value of the tools that engineers already use to yield deeper insights. And while we believe that data coupled with advanced algorithms can unlock enormous value, we believe that the greatest value of machine learning and AI is to better inform the engineers and operators who understand these complex systems inside and out.",2022-04-13T21:45:41.592Z

Noora Health claims to turn “hospital waiting rooms into classrooms,” where the family members of patients can not only learn health skills, but also practice them before having to take care of the discharged patient at home. Through the tools of its interactive platform, Noora Health has been proven to lower preventable readmissions and complications alongside with improve the level of care and patient satisfaction. Noora Health showcases immense promise in bolstering healthcare within developing countries, and I find that its model reminded me of one of A-Level Capital’s portfolio companies by the name of DrinkWell. I find that the combination of teaching “high-impact, and hands-on” health skills with a commitment to driving social impact exemplified by Noora Health makes it a potentially worthwhile investment to A-Level Capital. Hopkins Connection: The Co-Founder & President of Noora Health, Shahed Alam, received BS in Biomedical Engineering from Hopkins in 2009.

425,Subject7,"https://www.subject-7.com
https://www.linkedin.com/in/payamfard/

Founded in 2011 in Maryland, at Subject7, the story begins with software test automation. We, along with other industry experts, believe that in the new age of agile software development, organizations cannot succeed without a robust test automation platform. For over a decade, tool vendors have proposed scripting as the best way to tackle this hard problem. The script is created through a record-and-play mechanism or from scratch by a developer. As a result, another development shop is required to support and scale such scripts and hence the automation effort. As we all know development shops are both expensive and hard to assemble particularly with such scarce expertise. Budget and skilled resources are the main concerns for any automation project! 

A paradigm shift was required to increase success rate in automation projects. After working with Selenium RC and later Webdriver for few years, as Java architects, we decided to fuse different technologies to create an end-to-end platform on top of Selenium. This cloud-based SaaS platform called Proof, is designed to scale and be used by non developers (and Selenium developers) to help test automation projects succeed. We are a highly dedicated team, with quality at the center, guiding us intuitively to adapt to new technologies and achieve greater results.",2022-04-20T22:36:45.187Z

Oracle Problem is a well-known problem for blockchain - essentially, ‘How can everybody agree on a truth in the real world.” This is considered a very large problem in blockchain development - for example, a decentralized insurance policy can be this smart contract: “if the temperature goes above 100 degrees for 24 hours, a farmer will be reimbursed.” How do we agree what the temperature is, and where the thermometer goes - is it in the shade? Is it 99.5 degrees, or 100 degrees? Tellor aims to address this problem. It has applications in economics/finance (how do we agree on the price of something?), and many other industries.

Composed of three distinct types of wristbands, Atlas Wearables considers itself to be providing next-level fitness trackers due to their ability to recognize activity, count reps, and calculate calories burned. Atlas Wearables has managed to distinguish its products by marketing heavily towards individuals who prefer their workouts to be centered around strength training. The wristbands of Atlas Wearables are able to track more sophisticated metrics such as stability, volume, power, efficiency etc. In addition, the wristbands provide the unique feature of allowing users to load in their preferred workout and simply follow along by glancing down at their wrist. While making an investment decision on Atlas Wearables would require careful consideration in regards to both the quality of the technology and how it would compare to more well-recognized fitness trackers, the startup shows promise and has seemed to identify its market. The startup embodies another example of wearable technology attempting to improve health outcomes - an area in which A-Level Capital maintains expertise.

""Customer: Transit agencies and companies with a need for inventory tracking. For the transit agency application, subway riders are ultimate beneficiaries from transportation efficiency improvement (e.g. fewer train delays).

Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can provide centimeter accuracy location for subway train cars and has very low deployment cost. This enables subways to run closer together, increasing throughput. Metropolitan cities like New York face challenges upgrading existing infrastructure because of the level of disruption to service levels. Labor cost also makes construction duration the most signifanct determinant of infrastructure modernization expenditures. UWB technology can also be used by airports, manufacturing companies etc.

JJH Connect has also chosen open-source implementation of UWB technology, which reduces lifetime cost of operating, maintaining and upgrading signaling and communications systems.""

With USee, anyone, with less than a day of training, can a) measure refractive error, b) determine the lenses needed to correct vision, and c) snap the lenses into attractive frames. The entire process takes just minutes and does not require an eye-care professional. Both clinical and field trials have been successful.

--> created by Kevin White, flex MBA at Carey. Invented USee thru his company Global Vision 2020. The USee system was designed to help provide prescription eyeglasses to people in lower-income countries. 

How it works:
USee diagnostic tool works like a pair of binoculars and requires minimal training to operate. The patient looks through the device while turning a focus knob until they can see clearly. The USee kit includes an assortment of premade lenses, which correspond to measurements on the diagnostic tool. The premade lenses are snapped into a frame providing the patient with an instant pair of glasses.

An esophageal cancer diagnosis is something that nobody wants to hear.  Today, this cancer takes 16,000 lives in the United States each year. The primary reason - the current detection method, upper endoscopy, is both invasive and expensive, so it's often not used until symptoms arise.  In over 75% of cases, this is after the cancer has already spread and treatment options are limited, leading to esophageal cancer being the 3rd most lethal cancer in the United States (behind only pancreatic and lung cancer).

Capsulomics early-detection system combines a simple routine test given as part of routine care with our patented DNA biomarkers that accurately test for disease.  Our system is convenient, inexpensive, and accurate, so it can be given to those at risk before cancer symptoms, empowering patients to know earlier, receive necessary treatments, and live a healthier, longer life.",2019-09-29T21:34:13.234Z
